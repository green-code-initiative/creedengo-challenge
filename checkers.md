## üîß Tool suggestion

### [vJoule](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/vjoule/tree/v1.3.0) & [ETSdiff](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/ETSdiff) by [Davidson Consulting](https://www.davidson.fr/)

#### [vJoule](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/vjoule/tree/v1.3.0)

A tool that interfaces multiple sources of energy consumption and centralizes all energy readings in one place to provide a higher abstraction for developers and to help measure energy consumption.

- vjoule exec - used to estimate the energy consumption of a given command
- vjoule top - used to visualize the energy consumption of your computer and the cgroups monitored by vjoule service

[See **full documentation**](https://davidson-consulting.github.io/vjoule/v1.3/)

*Works on **Linux** on PC/servers (x86/64)*

#### [ETSdiff](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/ETSdiff)

An experimental tools that aims at the **differential analysis** of solutions producing an identical result within the framework of a **complete chain** of web applications.

To cover the whole chain and spots transfer impacts, ETSdiff uses 3 distinct indicators: Energy, Transfer and Storage. 

To insure good installation and understand how it work use this 2 projects:
- [ETSdiff-Test-Snippets](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/ETSdiff-Test-Snippets)
- [OpenDataBDD](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/OpenDataBDD)

*Works on **Linux** on PC/servers (x86/64)*

### Fruggr by Digital4better

- Evaluation of the accessibility of your websites and web applications
- GHG assessment of your IT infrastructure and compliance audits
- Measurement of the impact of your infrastructure through GreenOps analysis
- Evaluation of your sustainable digital maturity and support in your transition roadmap
- Analysis of your digital workplace footprint

#### Requirements

By default, Fruggr doesn't require many elements to operate.
For example, it may need access to your digital services or analytics accounts, cloud billing, and digital workplace billing.

### [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre/) by [Hubblo](https://hubblo.org/fr/)

[Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre/) monitors power and energy metrics of a server, desktop or laptop, and of each program (through PIDs and commandline of the processes) running on this machine.

[See **full documentation**](https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre-documentation/) for details, including [reference of metrics available](https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre-documentation/references/metrics.html).

#### Features

- measuring on **bare metal hosts**
- measuring on **qemu/kvm hypervisor** to get power usage and energy consumption of each virtual machine
- measuring and exposing power/energy metrics of a Qemu/KVM **virtual machine**, to allow manipulating those metrics in the VM as if it was a bare metal machine (relies on hypervisor features)
- **exposing** metrics as a **prometheus (HTTP) exporter**, see an [example of a grafana + prometheus setup](https://metrics.hubblo.org)
- sending metrics in **push mode** to a **prometheus Push Gateway**I
- sending metrics to **riemann**
- sending metrics to **Warp10**
- works on **kubernetes**, as a daemonset
- outputing power consumption metrics in a **JSON file**
- showing basic power consumption metrics **in the terminal**
- **packages** available for **RHEL** 8 and 9, **Debian** 11 and 12, **Windows**, and **NixOS** (community based)
- gets hosts's power from **RAPL PSYS** domain (full SoC / motherboard + attached components power) when available, or RAPL DPKG and DRAM (limited coverage : power consumed by CPU, memory and integrated graphic chipset)
- once in a timeseries database, metrics are easily searchable thanks to **labels**

#### Requirements

- CPU architecture supported : only **x86** CPUs, either Intel or AMD
- Operating Systems supported : **GNU/Linux** or **Windows** (from server 2016 to 2022, desktop 8, 10 and 11)
- Based on [RAPL (Running Average Power Limit)](https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre-documentation/explanations/rapl-domains.html) : only available on **CPUs built in 2011 and later**

### [Joular Project](https://github.com/joular/) by [UPPA](https://www.univ-pau.fr/)

- [PowerJoular](https://github.com/joular/powerjoular): monitors the power consumption for a process (PID) or an application (multi-pid). Works on **Linux** on PC/servers (x86/64) and ARM SBC (Raspberry Pi, TinkerBoard).
- [JoularJX](https://github.com/joular/joularjx): monitors the power consumption for each method and each execution branch in a Java application (in real time). Works on **Windows** (x86/64), **macOS** (Intel and Apple M chips), and **Linux** (PC/servers x86/64 and ARM SBC like Raspberry Pi).
- [PowDroid](https://github.com/joular/powdroid): monitors the power consumption of **Android** smartphones (system-wide). Works on any Android smartphone. Requires a USB cable and a computer to run the analysis (**Windows**, **macOS** or **Linux**).
