# Hello! Welcome to the spotter team ðŸ‘‹

As a spotter, you are here to improve ecoCode by finding new rules to implement on one of our static analyzers.

## Prerequisites

Here are the things you need to succeed in this challenge:

- your experience and your brain ðŸ˜¤
- a computer with an Internet connection should help to ask assistance to your favorite search engine or AI
- a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to share your hard work with the community

## ðŸ“œ Identify new ecodesign rules

### Does my rule already exist in ecoCode?

For Android and iOS rules, here are the rules laready found: [best praticices mobile](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile)

For other plugin rules, there is not a centralized place where all the implemented or in progress rules are listed. To check if your
rule already exists or was already proposed, please check the following sources:

- [ecoCode implemented rule specification folder](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/tree/main/ecocode-rules-specifications/src/main/rules): contains all the description of the implemented rules
- [ecoCode Rules.md](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/blob/main/RULES.md): a partial list of accepted and not accepted
   rules. Your new rule should not be here!
- [ecoCode canditate rules kanban](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/1/views/1): a list of work in progress rules.
- check the issues in the plugin project of the language of your rule. For example, for Java check [the Java ecoCode plugin issues](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-java/issues). Some rules there are not complete. If you found a duplication of your rule but you think that you have the missing justification (for example), ask a coach if you can complete the rule!

### What is a good rule definition?

Now you have an idea. You have check that it was not already submitted? Nice, you have a baby rule. Here are the things to do to transform it into a nice and mature rule:

- A short but explicit title
- The language / platform your rule applies
- A description of what your rule does (and does not do) **with code example**: what is the code my static analyzer must detect and why?
- **The justification of the rule**: documentation reference or measure (or at least an approach to perform the measure) that explain
  why your rule is pertinent

Good rule definition examples can be found here:

- [Example of rule definition with measure validation](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-challenge/issues/92)
- [Example of rule definition with documentation validation](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-challenge/issues/91)

### How do I submit my work?

You rule is ready and you want to submit it? Connect to [Green Code Initiative GitHub - ecoCode Challenge project](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-challenge) and perform the following steps:

1- Go to the `Issues` tab and click on the `New Issue` button
